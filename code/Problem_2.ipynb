    "\n",
    "The Hadamard ”coin” operator places the walker in a superposition of moving left and right simultaneously. This allows the ”edges” of the state’s wavefunction to always propagate outwards at the maximum possible speed (one step per time unit). Also, paths can have negative amplitudes in this case. When these paths recombine at later steps, they can cancel out (destructive interference) in the \"middle\" of the distribution, while constructively interfering at the \"edges,\" pushing the walker away from the origin much faster than is possible classically."
